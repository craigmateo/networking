# Module 3: Application Layer Services & Common Application Layer Protocols

The **Application Layer** is the highest abstraction layer in the TCP/IP model. It provides the interfaces and protocols needed by users to interact with the network.

### Main Functions of the Application Layer

- **Facilitates User Access**: Enables users to access network services.
- **Network-Based Application Development**: Supports the creation of applications that rely on the network.
- **User Services**: Provides services like user login, naming network devices, formatting messages and emails, and file transfer.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures proper error handling and recovery of messages as a whole.

### Common Protocols Supported at the Application Layer

- **Telnet**: Provides a terminal emulation service for remote login.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A secure remote login protocol that allows encrypted communication.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The foundation of data communication for the web.
- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: A secure version of HTTP that uses encryption.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Resolves human-readable domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol for sending email messages between servers.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
- **POP (Post Office Protocol)**: A protocol for retrieving email from a server.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**: A protocol for accessing and managing email on a server.
